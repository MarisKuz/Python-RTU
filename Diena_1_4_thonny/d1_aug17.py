print(5+6*10-1056)  # we use normal order of math operations

print(100/7)

# we can also get whole numbers when dividing
print(20/3)
print(20//3) # will be 6

# we can also get the reminder/modulo using %
print(20%3) # will be 2

# we can also raise powers
print(2**3)
print(2**8) # 2 to the 8th power will be 256
print(2**32) # our old limit for memory addressing in 32 bit systems
print(2**64) # should be enough for a few hundred years

# in Python we can work with huge numbers with no limits

print("beer")
print("beer " + "Labietis")

#print("beer"+3) will not work it does make sense
