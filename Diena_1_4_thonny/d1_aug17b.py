a = 1002 # in python we do not need to declare variables
# we simply start using variables
b = 3
c = a + b
d=a*b # do not necessarily need spaces, but spaces would be more common
print(a,b,c,d)
my_name = "Valdis"
print(my_name)
# if we put my_name in quotes it becomes just a string literal
print("my_name") # this will print exact string my_name

# for variables with many words Python prefers _ as divider
# there is another style
myName = "Valdis" # this is called CamelCase, less used in Python
print(my_name, myName)
