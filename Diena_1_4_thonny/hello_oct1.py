print(2+2)
print((5+6)*10)  # this is a comment for humans, order is regular arithmethic
print("beer "*4 + "cheese "*3)

print(100-10)
print(50/2)  # dividing gives us floating point - komats
print(2**3) # 2 cubed
print(2**8) # 2 to the power of 8
print(2**32) # for memory addressing only 4GB
print(2**64) # so 64 bits should be enough for a while
print(10 % 7) # reminder should be 3
print(20 % 7) # reminder should be 6 here
print(11 % 2) # reminder should be 1 here so this helps to determine odds from evens
